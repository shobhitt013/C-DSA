 /*Q->Can the same function name be used for different functions without any conflict?
Solution : 
The same function name can be used for different functions without any conflict if 
and only if they either have different data types for arguments or different number 
of arguments. Same function names cannot be used if functions differ only by their 
return type because the compiler would not then know which function is to be used. */
